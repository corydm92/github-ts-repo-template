# 3 — Project Stack Summary (`/docs/__project`)

## 🎯 Goal

Create a human-readable snapshot of the project’s **current** technical foundation.

This step answers:

- What tools are we using?
- What problem does each tool solve?
- Why was it chosen (at a high level)?

This is not an Architecture Decision Record and is not immutable.  
It’s onboarding-grade, current-state documentation.

Formal decisions and change control come later (Steps 4–6).

## 📦 What This Step Produces

This step produces **one artifact**:

- `docs/__project/stack-summary.md` — the living “current stack” document

No decisions are locked yet  
No change control happens here  
This file is allowed to evolve as the system evolves

The rule:

- ADRs define **decision history**
- Stack Summary reflects **current reality**

## 🧠 Mental Model

Think of the Stack Summary as the project’s “What are we running, and why?” page:

- It’s optimized for **speed of understanding**
- It describes the **present**, not the debate that led there
- It should be readable without code context
- It stays accurate by being updated **after** an ADR is accepted

Flow:

- Someone proposes a tool change → ADR
- ADR gets accepted → Stack Summary gets updated to match the new baseline
- Stack Summary always stays “the truth right now”

# Project Stack Summary

## Purpose

Provide a human-readable overview of the project’s technical stack.
Explain what tools are in use, what problems they solve, and why they were chosen.

This is not an Architecture Decision Record.
Formal decisions and changes are documented separately in ADRs.

---

## Layer 6 — Security & Observability

### Authentication & Authorization

Approach or provider

Why:

- protect user data
- enforce access control

How it’s implemented:

- session handling

# Project Stack Summary

## Purpose

Provide a human-readable overview of the project’s technical stack.
Explain what tools are in use, what problems they solve, and why they were chosen.

This is not an Architecture Decision Record.
Formal decisions and changes are documented separately in ADRs.

---

## System Overview

Project: Synct  
Primary Use Case: Collaborative data synchronization and workflow management  
Runtime Environment: hybrid (server + browser)

---

## Layer 1 — Language & Architecture

### Language

TypeScript 5.6 (strict)

Why:

- strong compile-time guarantees across a growing codebase
- shared contracts between server and client
- safer refactors with reduced runtime risk

How it’s enforced:

- strict compiler options enabled
- shared base tsconfig extended repo-wide
- typecheck required in CI

---

### Framework / Application Architecture

Next.js 16 (App Router)

Why:

- unified solution for routing, rendering, and data access
- supports hybrid rendering patterns without custom infra
- clean server/client boundaries for performance and correctness

How it’s used:

- App Router for routing
- server components for data access and mutations
- client components for interactive UI
- Suspense/streaming for async boundaries

---

## Layer 2 — State & Framework

### State Management

Redux Toolkit

Why:

- predictable state transitions for cross-cutting UI state
- clear ownership boundaries via slices

How it’s used:

- global store for UI/session-level state
- feature slices own their state shape
- explicit reducers/actions enforce predictable updates

---

### Data Fetching

TanStack Query + Next.js fetch

Why:

- consistent async data handling and cache behavior
- request deduplication, invalidation, background refetching

How data flows:

- server components fetch initial data
- TanStack Query hydrates and manages client cache
- mutations invalidate affected queries and refetch as needed

---

## Layer 3 — Quality & Stability

### Testing

Unit / Integration
Vitest

Why:

- fast, modern runner with strong TypeScript support
- good ergonomics for mocking and assertions

React Rendering
React Testing Library

Why:

- tests focus on user-visible behavior (not implementation details)
- stable patterns for component and hook integration tests

E2E
Playwright Test

Why:

- real browser confidence for critical workflows
- resilient cross-browser automation and debugging tools

Testing strategy:

- unit: pure logic, utilities, reducers
- integration: component behavior with RTL + Vitest
- E2E: critical user journeys (routing, auth, data mutation flows)

Notes:

- async server-component flows are validated via E2E where unit testing isn’t a good fit

---

### Linting & Formatting

ESLint + Prettier

Why:

- consistent code style across contributors
- early detection of common errors

How it’s enforced:

- shared repo config
- pre-commit hooks for auto-fix
- CI fails on lint violations

---

## Layer 4 — UI & Experience

### Styling System

Tailwind CSS

Why:

- consistent tokens and styling patterns across the app
- scales well with component-based UI
- predictable output with minimal custom CSS drift

How it’s structured:

- centralized theme configuration
- utility-first styles at component level
- minimal custom CSS

---

### Component Strategy

Composable primitives + feature-level components

Why:

- promotes reuse without premature abstraction
- accessibility handled at the primitive level

How components are built:

- primitives handle semantics and accessibility
- feature components compose primitives near domain logic
- clear ownership and reuse rules prevent component sprawl

---
