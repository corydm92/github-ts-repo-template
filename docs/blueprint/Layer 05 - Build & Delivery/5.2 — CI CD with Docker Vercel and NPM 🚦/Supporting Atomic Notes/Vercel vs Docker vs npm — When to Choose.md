# Vercel vs Docker vs npm — When to Choose

## Vercel

- Frontend web apps
- Preview deployments on PRs
- Fast static + serverless deployments

## Docker

- APIs, background workers, services
- Environments that need full OS-level control
- Centralized container registry flow

## npm

- Shared libraries or SDKs
- Consumers install via package manager
- Release driven by version tags
