# Local Dev Checklist

## First-time setup

```
corepack enable
corepack use pnpm@10.28.2
pnpm install
```

## Before committing

```
pnpm run ci
```

## App-only checks

From repo root:

```
pnpm -C apps/<app> run ci
```

## Common pitfalls

- Run `pnpm install` at the repo root.
- Each app must define a `ci` script if it’s expected to be checked.
