# Deployment Targets Matrix

This repo supports multiple app types under `/apps`.
Each app should document its deployment target in its README.

| App | Intended Target | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| frontend | Vercel or Docker | Pick one per project |
| backend | Docker / service host | Avoid Vercel for long-running servers |
| db | Managed DB + migrations | Not a deploy target by itself |
| infra | Terraform | Applied outside app runtime |
